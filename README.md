I started uploading code on the 21st Dec 2012. (which means the planet called earth still existed at this particular moment in time)

I've done my best to make sure I actually have working code in my repository, but as these things go: No warranty of any sort, and even if it is broken, I'm not promissing to fix it. 

This code is just a record of my travels through Arduino land, and once something is working to my satisfacion, I tend to move on to a next stage. Some projects are useful in there own right, others are just 'musings'.

In any way, feel free to use anything as you see fit.

Most of my code starts life as something I have found on Jeelabs (Thanks JC) or strolling around the interweb.
If I borrowed your code, thanks, if I did not know I borrowed yours and forget to mention you, my appologies, and do drop me a mail to tell me. If code is all my own: don't thank me, you take your life in your own hands!

All the best for 2013,

Kees Blokland.
